GoChatWs is a chat web service project with the backend written in Go. Htmx is one of the tools used to create dynamic user interfaces, a modern hypermedia tool that allows users to have a SPA-like experience. Alpine.js, a lightweight JavaScript framework, is another essential component that promotes component-based development, making the application scalable and manageable.
Websockets and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure and real-time communication. Websockets enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server, while JWT provides a secure method for user authentication. This combination of technologies ensures a robust, secure, and interactive service.
